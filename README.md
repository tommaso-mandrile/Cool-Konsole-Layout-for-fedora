## To Do before launching COOLKonsoleStarter.sh 
Open the terminal in this folder and run installPrograms.sh

---

##### **installPrograms.sh** will:
+  Copy "BashCommands/fire.sh" in "usr/local/bin" under the name of "fire_effect"
+ Update your system
+ Install requested applications (btop, fastfetch,cacafire)

### Notes:
    I heavely suggest to assign a shortcut (like "Meta+Enter")
    to run the COOLKonsoleStarter.sh program so that you can
    open this layout whenever you want.
